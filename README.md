# Chapter I

# Introduction

_C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia)._

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to **Object-Oriented Programming**.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!


# Chapter II

# General rules

**Compiling**

- Compile your code withc++and the flags-Wall -Wextra -Werror
- Your code should still compile if you add the flag-std=c++

```
Formatting and naming conventions
```
- The exercise directories will be named this way:ex00, ex01, ... , exn
- Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in
    the guidelines.
- Write class names in **UpperCamelCase** format. Files containing class code will
    always be named according to the class name. For instance:
    ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h,ClassName.cpp, orClassName.tpp. Then, if you
    have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
    brick wall, its name will beBrickWall.hpp.
- Unless specified otherwise, every output messages must be ended by a new-line
    character and displayed to the standard output.
- _Goodbye Norminette!_ No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
    follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that a code your peer-evaluators can’t
    understand is a code they can’t grade. Do your best to write a clean and readable
    code.

```
Allowed/Forbidden
```
```
You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:
```
- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
    of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use as much as possible
    the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.
- However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
    forms) andBoostlibraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
    too:*printf(),*alloc()andfree(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
    that’s it.


C++ - Module 07 C++ templates

- Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, theusing namespace <ns_name>and
    friendkeywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.
- **You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only.** That means:
    no **Containers** (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no **Algorithms** (anything that
    requires to include the<algorithm>header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
    be -42.

```
A few design requirements
```
- Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using thenew
    keyword), you must avoid **memory leaks**.
- From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the **Orthodox**
    **Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise**.
- Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)
    means 0 to the exercise.
- You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
    they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
    problem of double inclusion by adding **include guards**. Otherwise, your grade will
    be 0.

```
Read me
```
- You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
    assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
    the mandatory files.
- Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show
    requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.
- Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
- By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

```
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.
```
```
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.

# Chapter III

# Exercise 00: Start with a few

# functions

```
Exercise : 00
```
```
Start with a few functions
Turn-in directory : ex 00 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, whatever.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions :None
```
```
Implement the following function templates:
```
- swap: Swaps the values of two given arguments. Does not return anything.
- min: Compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the smallest
    one. If the two of them are equal, then it returns the second one.
- max: Compares the two values passed in its arguments and returns the greatest one.
    If the two of them are equal, then it returns the second one.

These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is
that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison
operators.

```
Templates must be defined in the header files.
```

C++ - Module 07 C++ templates

```
Running the following code:
```
```
int main( void ) {
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
::swap( a, b );
std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( a, b ) = " << ::min( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( a, b ) = " << ::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::string c = "chaine1";
std::string d = "chaine2";
::swap(c, d);
std::cout << "c = " << c << ", d = " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( c, d ) = " << ::min( c, d ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( c, d ) = " << ::max( c, d ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
```
Should output:
```
```
a = 3, b = 2
min(a, b) = 2
max(a, b) = 3
c = chaine2, d = chaine
min(c, d) = chaine
max(c, d) = chaine
```

# Chapter IV

# Exercise 01: Iter

```
Exercise : 01
```
```
Iter
Turn-in directory : ex 01 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, iter.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions :None
```
```
Implement a function templateiterthat takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.
```
- The first parameter is the address of an array.
- The second one is the length of the array.
- The third one is a function that will be call on every element of the array.

Turn in amain.cppfile that contains your tests. Provide enough code to generate a
test executable.

Youriterfunction template must work with any type of array. The third parameter
can be an instantiated function template.


# Chapter V

# Exercise 02: Array

```
Exercise : 02
```
```
Array
Turn-in directory : ex 02 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Array.{h, hpp}
and optional file: Array.tpp
Forbidden functions :None
```
Develop a class template **Array** that contains elements of typeTand that implements
the following behavior and functions:

- Construction with no parameter: Creates an empty array.
- Construction with an unsigned intnas a parameter: Creates an array ofnelements
    initialized by default.
    Tip: Try to compileint * a = new int();then display*a.
- Construction by copy and assignment operator. In both cases, modifying either the
    original array or its copy after copying musn’t affect the other array.
- You MUST use the operatornew[]to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (al-
    locating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non-
    allocated memory.
- Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].
- When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an
    std::exceptionis thrown.
- A member functionsize()that returns the number of elements in the array. This
    member function takes no parameter and musn’t modify the current instance.

As usual, ensure everything works as expected and turn in amain.cppfile that con-
tains your tests.
